- Decided to use vanilla js
- Had some issues at first with date filtering
- Decided to use litepicker for calendar
- Once basic functionality was done, started styling
- Decided it was better to just start with mobile version
- Finished mobile, decided to expand row to inspect email
- Finished desktop version which was tricky
- Gave final inspection, make sure everything looked okay
